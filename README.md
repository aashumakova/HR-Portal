## HR portal App
- This is a healthcare app that allows managers to keep track of their employees. The manager can add new employees, delete employees, edit employees' info and update their nursinf license status. If the manager is out of the office, other managers have access to this info. Any manager who is temporary in charge of said employee can write an annual review. Annual reviews cannot be deleted or edited to allow for transparency and straight record keeping. Users who are not logged in can only see the list of current employees.
